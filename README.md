# Leveraging Blockchain For Auditable Access Control and Log Management 
Recent crime reports highlight the ubiquity of digital evidence in global criminal activities. Effective management of digital evidence is crucial to streamline investigations, secure evidence repositories, reduce backlogs, and efficiently handle digital artifacts. Traditional centralized digital evidence management (DEM) systems encounter challenges such as single points of failure, trust issues and performance bottlenecks. In response to these challenges, decentralized digital evidence management systems emerged, offering improved reliability but still suffering from vulnerabilities like lack of fine-grained access control and  insider threats .Our paper presents a novel approach to introduce a blockchain-based access control and log management framework tailored for DEMs. This framework leverages the BIBA Integrity Model, implemented using smart contracts, to provide a uniform format for access control and increase interoperability. By utilizing blockchain technology, our framework ensures the secure and tamper-proof storage of access logs and evidence-related transactions, thereby mitigating insider threats and enhancing the overall security and reliability of the system. We provide a detailed security comparison with existing models and validate our framework using BAN Logic. Additionally, we present a practical implementation of our model through smart contracts, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness in managing access logs for digital evidence in DEM systems
